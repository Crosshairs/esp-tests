COLORSPACE CONVERSION

This T0 program converts an input RGB image to a YCrCb image.  For more
info on colorspaces check out http://icsl.ee.washington.edu/
~zjin/thesis/node10.html.  As the program now stands, the output image is
simply a ppm file, with the Y represented as red, the Cr as G, and Cb as
B.

The program is run like this:

spertrun ./conv in.ppm out.ppm

The trace shows that the VP0 (multipliers) are almost totally saturated,
with a single idle cycle after the loop branch.  This might be improved
with a little more work.
